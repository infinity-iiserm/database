## The Man Who Never Lived

Exactly 211 years ago on this day, a man was born in the French Empire. At the age of 14, he read Legendre's *Éléments de Géométrie* like a "novel". At 15, he was reading original papers of Lagrange. Unfortunately, his methods were so unconventional that he failed college entrance examinations because he was unable to provide oral explanations for his answers. He submitted two papers (on continued fractions and polynomial equations) for publication both of which were declined. He made another attempt to get into his preferred institute and failed yet again.

He lived during a time of political turmoil in France. As a result of his political activism, he was arrested repeatedly, serving one jail sentence of several months. During his time in jail, he learnt drinking from fellow inmates and while he was drunk, he uttered, *"I will die in a duel. Why? Because she will invite me to avenge her honor which another has compromised"*. This would later become a shocking prophecy about his death.

After he was released from jail, he tried giving math lessons but due to his unconventional methods, barely any student showed up. He fell in love with the daughter of the physician of the hostel he was staying in. Soon, her fiancé found out and challenged him to a duel. He was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed all night feverishly scribbling down his math ideas all the while uttering *"I have no time"* the night before his death. After getting fatally injured, his last words to his younger brother were, *"Don't weep Alfred, I need all my courage to die at twenty!"*.

He was 20 when he died. He was Évariste Galois. Little did he know during his final moments that what he wrote would keep mathematicians busy for the next 200 years. His writings founded group theory and Galois theory.

We wish Évariste Galois a happy birthday! The man nobody understood. The man who never lived. Today, his contributions are so fundamental to mathematics and have applications in various areas of sciences.
